=addSlave= seems to add a server/slave/agent to the resource pool. 
file:../src/master/allocator/mesos/allocator.hpp
Called only once, in _registerSlave or _reregisterSlave in file:../src/master/master.cpp


=Master::resourceRequest= handles requests from frameworks calls =request=, which calls the =allocator->requestResources()=. Strangely, resourceRequest is not called by anyone?

*Presumably, I will have to call CRM->requestResources first to actually create and add slave nodes?*

=allocator->requestResources()= is called from:
sched.cpp - just a "send" message.
AND NOWHERE ELSE REALLY!?

Can have an autoscaler module which does instance management and retains unused servers for 10 X start-up time, etc. 


Mesos ec2 auto-scaling from outside :

cpus_free = cluster.state['master/cpus_total'] - cluster.state['master/cpus_used']

*Question: How to get application resource requirements??*
