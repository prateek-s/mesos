=addSlave= seems to add a server/slave/agent to the resource pool. 
file:../src/master/allocator/mesos/allocator.hpp
Called only once, in _registerSlave or _reregisterSlave in file:../src/master/master.cpp


Can have an autoscaler module which does instance management and retains unused servers for 10 X start-up time, etc.
