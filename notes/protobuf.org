** Adding an entry in the protobuf 

Add matching definitions in include/mesos/scheduler/scheduler.proto *and* include/mesos/v1/scheduler/scheduler.proto 

Add CloudInfoMessage in src/messages/messages.proto 

Add evolve defintion in src/internal/evolve.cpp and hpp 

QUESTION: Why is there a mutable_info() and not a mutable_cloudinfo() ? How did the protocol buffer compiler smartly pick info (and warning) from cloudinfo and terminationWarning?
