How to react to warnings?

slave updates master.
- Status update mechanism
- explicit HTTP call machine/pending_termination

1. WarningWatcher makes http call to slave 
   Why cant warning watcher directly call the master? Being routed from the slave/agent makes more sense, since it is essentially an agent event, not a clusterwide event that the master should know of first. 
2. Slave immediately sends machine termination warning message to master 
3. Master creates set of affected machines and sends inverse offers to all affected frameworks.
