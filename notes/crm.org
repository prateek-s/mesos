#+TITLE: Cloud Resource Manager

* Implementation
Added crm.cpp file in CmakeLists.txt. Otherwise, get undefined reference error. Argh  

run cmake .. from the build directory after modifying this file 

Apparently CMAKE is not the main build tool for the project, because it was not compiling the master.cpp file at all.

Mesos still uses automake by default, so added the crm.cpp file in src/Makefile.am . Confirm that after running configure, it is also added in src/Makefile.in 

* Design
