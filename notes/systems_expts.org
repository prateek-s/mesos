** Run BOINC on ExoSphere 

Revocation -> Checkpoint 
Revocation -> Ignore 

Measure job completion time 

BOINC is bag of tasks . Also change number of pools here! 
10 servers total? Or 5? 
All in one mkt
2 mkts
3
4
5 etc.

Inject revocation in one market. Show what happens to BOINC throughput 

Repeat the same for Spark 3 Flint workloads + TPC-H also 

Spark has completion time as metric. What about BOINC? 

BOINC tasks may not be of the same length sadly. Computation units performed? Lost? 

For repeatability, use a load-generator framework which we can checkpoint-restart etc.

Maybe mesos-sim? Simulate lost tasks by checkpointing policy etc, measure other things.

Checkpoint will require sleeping etc though!!




** Grand experiment 

COMES LAST after other expts are done 

Run Spark, Boinc, MPI at the same time
Revoke one market 
Show what happens to each with different policies
